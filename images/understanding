Step 1: Scrape Metrics

Prometheus makes an HTTP request to the target server’s /metrics endpoint (e.g., Node Exporter on 9100).

The target returns metrics in text format:

node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="server1", mode="idle"} 12345.67
node_memory_usage_bytes{instance="server1"} 567890


Prometheus parses these lines and converts them into time series (metric + labels + timestamp + value).

Step 2: Store Metrics in TSDB

Prometheus writes the metric samples into its built-in time series database (TSDB).

TSDB organizes data as:

Metric name + labels → time series

Chunks of consecutive samples for efficiency

Indexes for fast lookup by label combinations

Example time series stored:

Metric Name	Labels	Timestamp	Value
node_cpu_seconds_total	instance="server1", mode="idle"	2025-11-25 12:00	12345.7
node_cpu_seconds_total	instance="server1", mode="idle"	2025-11-25 12:15	12346.1

The TSDB is append-only, meaning new samples are just added sequentially.

Step 3: Evaluate Rules

Prometheus evaluates alerting and recording rules at every evaluation_interval:

Alerting Rules

Example: High CPU usage

expr: 100 - (avg by(instance) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100) > 40
for: 2m


Prometheus calculates this expression using the stored metrics.

If the condition is true for the specified for duration, it fires an alert.

Recording Rules

Precomputes frequently used metrics for dashboards:

- record: instance:cpu_usage:rate5m
  expr: 100 - (avg by(instance) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)


Stores these results as new time series in TSDB for faster queries.

Step 4: Send Alerts to Alertmanager

Fired alerts are sent to Alertmanager via HTTP API.

Prometheus does not handle notifications directly; Alertmanager handles grouping, deduplication, silencing, and delivery (PagerDuty, Slack, email, etc.).

Step 5: Serve Metrics to Clients

Prometheus exposes metrics on its own HTTP endpoint (http://localhost:9090/metrics).

Grafana or other tools query Prometheus via PromQL for dashboards or charts.

Step 6: Repeat Continuously

Prometheus repeats this process:

Scrape targets every scrape_interval (e.g., 15s)

Evaluate rules every evaluation_interval (e.g., 15s)

Send alerts and update TSDB continuously

💡 Analogy:

Prometheus is like a watchful scientist:

Measures everything periodically (scraping)

Records observations carefully in a notebook (TSDB)

Checks if conditions are dangerous (alert rules)

Calls a responder if something is wrong (Alertmanager)

Shares results with observers (Grafana)


1️⃣ Chunks

Definition:
A chunk is a small, contiguous block of consecutive metric samples stored on disk.

Why chunks?

Writing every single metric sample directly to disk would be inefficient.

By grouping samples into chunks, Prometheus can:

Write efficiently in batches

Compress data to save space

Retrieve consecutive data quickly

Example:

Say Prometheus scrapes CPU usage every 15 seconds. For one time series:

Timestamp	Value
12:00	5
12:15	7
12:30	6
12:45	8
13:00	5

Prometheus may store these 5 samples in one chunk.

Older chunks are compacted into larger chunks for storage efficiency.

Key points about chunks:

Each chunk contains samples of a single time series.

Chunks are append-only.

Chunks have metadata (start time, end time) for fast access.

2️⃣ Index

Definition:
The index is a data structure that allows Prometheus to quickly find which chunks belong to which time series.

Why an index?

Prometheus can have millions of time series (one per metric+label combination).

Without an index, finding the data for node_cpu_seconds_total{instance="server1"} would require scanning all chunks — very slow.

How it works:

Each time series is identified by metric name + labels.

The index stores a mapping:

metric_name + labels → list of chunk locations on disk


When PromQL queries data (e.g., CPU usage last 5 minutes), Prometheus:

Looks up the time series in the index

Retrieves the relevant chunks from disk

Reads the samples from chunks

Analogy:

Chunks = pages of a notebook containing consecutive measurements.

Index = table of contents that tells you which pages contain data for each metric+label combination.

3️⃣ Combined Flow
[Scrape metrics] 
      │
      ▼
[Time series samples] → stored in [chunks]
      │
      ▼
[index] keeps track: metric+labels → chunks locations
      │
      ▼
[PromQL query] → check index → load chunks → return samples

Key Notes

Chunks = store actual metric samples

Index = maps metric+labels → chunks for fast lookup

Both together allow Prometheus to efficiently store millions of time series and answer queries quickly.

Older chunks can be compacted, while the index is updated to reflect chunk locations.
